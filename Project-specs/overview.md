# Tracker – Overview

**What it is:** A personal execution tracker that blends **daily tasks**, **habit streaks**, and **gym logging** into one simple dashboard.

**Who it’s for:** Individuals who want to see if they’re actually doing what they said they’d do every day.

**Why:** To make consistency visible. If you can see streaks break, task completion drop, or training volume sag, you can fix it quickly.

## Goals
- Track **today’s commitments** (tasks) and **long-term consistency** (habits).
- Log **workouts** with enough detail to measure progress (sets, reps, weight).
- Show a simple **dashboard** that answers: *Am I slipping?*

## Non-Goals (for now)
- Team/coach sharing, public profiles
- Wearables integrations
- Complex nutrition tracking
