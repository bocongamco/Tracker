# Roadmap & Sprints

**Process:** Solo Agile, 2-week sprints, deliver working software each sprint. Keep a small backlog; do a retro each time.

## Sprint 1 – Foundations (2 weeks)
**Goal:** CRUD for Tasks/Habits + daily loop.
- EF entities & migrations (Users, DailyTasks, Habits, HabitLogs)
- Endpoints for tasks/habits/logs
- Angular pages: Today Tasks, Habits list + daily tick
**Done when:** I can add tasks & habits, tick today, and see completion %.

## Sprint 2 – Gym Basics (2 weeks)
**Goal:** Log workouts reliably.
- Entities: Exercises, MuscleGroups, ExerciseMuscles, WorkoutSessions, WorkoutSets
- Angular: Start session → add sets → view history
**Done when:** I can log a session and see history.

## Sprint 3 – Dashboard & Metrics (2 weeks)
**Goal:** See if I’m slipping.
- Aggregations: 7-day task completion; habit streaks; 4-week volume by muscle
- Dashboard UI (cards + simple charts)
**Done when:** Dashboard shows today status + trends.

## Sprint 4 – Quality of Life (2 weeks)
**Goal:** Make it stick.
- Recurring tasks; carry-over unfinished tasks
- Workout templates; CSV export
**Done when:** I can schedule recurring items, reuse templates, export data.
